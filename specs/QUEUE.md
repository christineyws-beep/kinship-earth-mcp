# Spec Queue — Autonomous Nightly Sessions

> This file is the source of truth for what the nightly autonomous session should work on.
> Each session reads this file, picks the next `ready` spec, executes it, and marks it `done`.

## How It Works

1. Session starts, reads this file
2. Finds the first spec with status `ready`
3. Reads that spec file for detailed instructions
4. Executes the spec: build, test, commit, push
5. Updates this file: marks spec as `done`, adds completion notes
6. Opens a PR or pushes to the feature branch
7. Writes a burn-down summary as a commit message

### Status Key
- `ready` — spec is written, detailed, and executable autonomously
- `queued` — placeholder, spec not yet written (session should skip and flag)
- `in_progress` — currently being worked on
- `done` — completed, committed, pushed
- `blocked` — cannot proceed, see notes

## Inventory

- **Specs ready:** 3
- **Specs queued (need writing):** 0
- **Specs done:** 11
- **Buffer:** 3 specs ready, 11 done

> When buffer drops to 2 or fewer, the next interactive session should prioritize writing more specs.
