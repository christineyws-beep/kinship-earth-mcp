- [x] Federated relevance ranking (geo × taxon × temporal × quality)
- [x] GeoJSON export
- [x] Full provenance + CARE principles tracking
- [x] Schema snapshot tool for upstream API monitoring
- [x] Jupyter notebook examples

- [x] Phase 2/3 schema types: `EcologicalAnomaly`, `EcologicalEvent`, `EcosystemState`

---

## Phase 2 — MCP Maturity (Next)

**Goal:** Make the MCP server a first-class agentic tool — richer interactions, composable workflows, structured outputs that help agents generate better UI.

**Duration:** 3–4 weeks

### Milestone 2.1 — Prompt Templates & Resources
MCP prompts let agents invoke curated multi-step workflows with a single call.

- [x] `ecological_survey` prompt — comprehensive biodiversity + climate + soil report for a location
- [x] `species_report` prompt — deep dive on a single species: occurrences, climate correlation, audio, soil
- [x] `site_comparison` prompt — structured comparison of 2+ locations across all data sources
- [x] `data_export` prompt — guided export in CSV, GeoJSON, Markdown report, or BibTeX
- [x] MCP resource: `ecology://sources` — live registry of available data sources and their status

### Milestone 2.2 — Workflow Composition Tools
Higher-level tools that chain existing tools into research workflows.

- [x] `ecology_biodiversity_assessment` — chains search → climate → soil → synthesis for a location
- [x] `ecology_temporal_comparison` — "what changed here between date A and date B?"
- [x] `ecology_export` — tool that outputs structured CSV, GeoJSON, Markdown report, or BibTeX with DOIs
- [x] `ecology_cite` — given a set of observations, produce properly formatted citations

### Milestone 2.3 — Output Structure for Agent UI
Help agents render better visualizations without prescribing the UI.

- [x] Add `visualization_hint` field to all tool responses (e.g., `"map"`, `"timeseries"`, `"comparison_table"`, `"species_gallery"`)
- [x] Add `map_data` structured field with GeoJSON + suggested bounds + layer groupings
- [x] Add `chart_data` structured field with labeled axes, series, and suggested chart type
- [ ] Document output schema for agent/client developers

### Phase 2 Definition of Done
- All 4 prompts registered and functional in Claude Desktop
- Workflow tools return structured data that Claude can render as artifacts (maps, charts)
- Existing tests still pass; new tests for workflow tools
- README updated with new capabilities

---

## Phase 3 — Auth & Persistence

**Goal:** Add identity and conversation memory so the system can learn from usage.

**Duration:** 4–5 weeks

**Dependency:** Decision on hosting model (authenticated MCP proxy vs. platform service)

### Milestone 3.1 — Authenticated MCP Proxy
A thin service layer that wraps the MCP server with auth.

- [ ] OAuth provider integration (Google and/or GitHub)
- [x] User identity model (Supabase or Auth0 + Postgres)
- [ ] Authenticated MCP transport (SSE with auth headers)
- [x] Free tier usage metering (queries/day)
- [x] BYOK API key vault (user provides their own eBird key, etc.)

### Milestone 3.2 — Conversation Persistence
Store every agent conversation for future memory graph ingestion.

- [x] Conversation storage schema (who, when, what tools called, what returned, what feedback given)
- [x] Dual-write to local SQLite (dev) + Supabase/Postgres (prod)
- [x] Per-message feedback capture (thumbs up/down, correction, annotation)
- [x] Conversation replay / export for users
- [ ] Privacy controls: per-user opt-in for shared memory, data deletion

### Milestone 3.3 — Extract Web App Components
Migrate reusable pieces from `kinship-earth-web` into the MCP platform.

- [ ] Port auth flow from web app to proxy service
- [ ] Port conversation storage schema
- [ ] Port feedback widget logic (as MCP tool: `ecology_feedback`)
- [ ] Port export logic as MCP tools (already planned in 2.2)
- [ ] Archive `kinship-earth-web` repo (or mark as deprecated)

### Phase 3 Definition of Done
- Users can authenticate and use Kinship Earth MCP with persistent identity
- Conversations are stored and associated with user accounts
- Feedback is captured per interaction
- Web app functionality fully migrated or archived
- Privacy controls documented and functional

## Phase 4 — Memory Graph

**Goal:** Build the ecological knowledge graph that compounds from every conversation.

**Duration:** 6–8 weeks

**Dependency:** Phase 3 (need conversations + identity to feed the graph)

### Milestone 4.1 — Graph Infrastructure
- [x] Evaluate and select graph engine (Graphiti vs. custom Neo4j vs. Memgraph + pgvector)
- [x] Design entity ontology: Species, Location, Watershed, Ecosystem, Researcher, Query, Finding, Anomaly
- [x] Design relationship types: OBSERVED_AT, INHABITS, DRAINS_TO, CORRELATES_WITH, ASKED_ABOUT, SIMILAR_TO
- [x] Temporal edge model (validity windows, fact versioning — "temperature normal was X until 2024, now Y")
- [ ] Implement graph write pipeline: conversation → entity extraction → graph upsert

### Milestone 4.2 — Memory-Aware MCP Tools
New tools that query the memory graph alongside live data.

- [ ] `ecology_related_queries` — "3 other researchers queried this watershed last month, focusing on salmonid habitat"
- [ ] `ecology_location_history` — "this location has been queried 47 times; top species of interest: coho salmon, steelhead"
- [ ] `ecology_emerging_patterns` — "across all users, eBird observations of species X have shifted 50km north over 3 years"
- [ ] `ecology_memory_store` — agent explicitly saves an insight to the graph ("researcher confirmed coho spawning at this tributary")
- [ ] `ecology_memory_recall` — retrieve relevant memory nodes for a given location/species/time

### Milestone 4.3 — Memory-Informed Ranking
Existing search results get re-ranked based on graph context.

- [ ] Add memory_relevance component to federated ranking score
- [ ] Weight observations higher if the location/species has active research interest
- [ ] Surface "you might also want to know" connections from the graph
- [ ] A/B test: memory-informed vs. baseline ranking (measure user feedback signals)

### Phase 4 Definition of Done
- Knowledge graph populated from stored conversations
- Memory tools return meaningful results for locations/species with conversation history
- Ranking incorporates memory signals
- Cold-start strategy working (valuable even with sparse graph)
- Privacy model enforced (per-user vs. shared memory)

## Phase 5 — Ecosystem Intelligence

**Goal:** Move from reactive queries to proactive ecological monitoring and anomaly detection.

**Duration:** 8–12 weeks

**Dependency:** Phase 4 (graph provides baseline patterns for anomaly detection)

### Milestone 5.1 — Continuous Monitoring
- [ ] `EcosystemState` continuous computation for monitored locations
- [ ] Baseline calculation from ERA5 + NEON + USGS historical data
- [ ] Scheduled data pulls (cron or event-driven) for active monitoring sites

### Milestone 5.2 — Anomaly Detection
- [ ] Implement `EcologicalAnomaly` detection pipeline (schema already defined)
- [ ] Temperature, flow, phenological, acoustic, composition anomaly detectors
- [ ] Alert tool: `ecology_check_anomalies` — "any unusual signals at this location?"
- [ ] Anomaly → graph edge: anomalies become first-class graph entities

### Milestone 5.3 — Event Synthesis
- [ ] Implement `EcologicalEvent` classification (schema already defined)
- [ ] Multi-anomaly → event correlation (e.g., low flow + high temp + die-off = drought cascade)
- [ ] Historical analog matching ("this looks like the 2021 Klamath drought cascade")
- [ ] Proactive notifications: agent subscribes to locations and gets alerted

### Milestone 5.4 — Additional Data Sources
- [ ] Movebank (animal tracking / migration data)
- [ ] FLUXNET (carbon/water/energy flux towers)
- [ ] Wildlife Insights (camera trap imagery)
- [ ] Copernicus Land (satellite-derived land cover, NDVI)

### Phase 5 Definition of Done
- At least 5 monitored locations with continuous EcosystemState
- Anomaly detection firing on real data with <24hr latency
- Events synthesized from multi-signal anomalies
- Graph contains temporal ecological state history
- Agents can subscribe to location alerts

## Open Questions

1. **Hosting model:** Authenticated MCP proxy on Railway/Fly? Or platform service with managed MCP endpoints?
2. **Graph engine:** Graphiti (built for agent memory) vs. Neo4j (mature, rich query language) vs. Memgraph (performance)?
3. **Pricing model:** Free tier → paid? Per-query? Per-user? API key marketplace?
4. **Data governance:** How do we handle shared memory across users for indigenous land / CARE-restricted data?
5. **Multi-tenancy:** Separate graphs per organization, or one global graph with access controls?
