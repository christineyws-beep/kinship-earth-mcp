Evaluative Tests: Scientist Persona Research Scenarios
======================================================

PURPOSE
-------
These tests simulate real interdisciplinary research workflows — the kind of
questions that are currently unanswerable because data lives in silos across
different databases, formats, and query interfaces.

Each test module is a scientist persona with a multi-step research workflow.
They don't just check "does the code run?" — they verify that the system
returns data that is scientifically meaningful, cross-referenced, and
sufficient to actually answer the research question.

WHAT MAKES THESE DIFFERENT FROM UNIT TESTS
------------------------------------------
Unit tests:  "Does OBIS return records when I search for a species?"
Persona tests: "Can a marine ecologist studying climate-driven range shifts
               get OBIS occurrence data AND ERA5 temperature data for the same
               spatiotemporal window, with provenance good enough to cite in a
               paper, and quality metadata good enough to filter by?"

These tests exercise the ORCHESTRATOR — the cross-source layer that is the
unique value of Kinship Earth.

PERSONAS
--------
1. Marine Climate Ecologist — climate-driven species redistribution
2. Watershed Ecologist — terrestrial-marine boundary effects
3. Phenology Researcher — seasonal timing shifts under warming
4. Climate Validation Scientist — ground-truthing reanalysis with in-situ data

# PERSONA 1: Marine Climate Ecologist
# Research question: "Did the 2021 Pacific heat dome shift cetacean
# distributions in the North Pacific?"

# Why this is currently hard: A researcher must manually query OBIS for
# cetacean records, separately download ERA5 from Copernicus (different auth,
# NetCDF format, different coordinate grid), align temporal windows, and
# wrangle both into the same analysis. Days of work before any science.
#
# What Kinship Earth should enable: one query returns species occurrences
# AND climate context for the same spatiotemporal window.
