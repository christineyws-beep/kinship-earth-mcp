"""
Kinship Earth Orchestrator — cross-source ecological intelligence tools.

This is the unique value of Kinship Earth. No individual data source can
answer cross-domain questions like "what was the climate when this species
was observed?" or "what ecological data exists for this location?"

The orchestrator coordinates across NEON, OBIS, and ERA5 (and future sources)
to answer higher-level ecological questions.

Tools are unprefixed with 'ecology_' per the architecture conventions:
- ecology_get_environmental_context — climate + sensors for a point/time
- ecology_search — unified search across all sources
- ecology_describe_sources — what data is available

Run locally:   uv run mcp dev src/kinship_orchestrator/server.py
Run via HTTP:  uv run python -m kinship_orchestrator.server

    Get the full environmental context for a location and time.

    This is the flagship cross-source tool. Given a point on Earth and a date,
    it pulls climate data from ERA5 and finds the nearest NEON monitoring sites.
    Use this to understand the environmental conditions when and where a species
    was observed, or to characterize a study site.

    Args:
        lat: Latitude in decimal degrees (e.g. 45.82 for Wind River).
        lon: Longitude in decimal degrees (e.g. -121.95). Negative = West.

        days_before: Number of days before the focal date to include in the

    Unified ecological search across all Kinship Earth data sources.

    Searches OBIS (marine species) and NEON (terrestrial sites) simultaneously,

    For source-specific queries with more control, use the individual servers:
